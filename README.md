# Audio Effect Detection

As a musician, I often want to replicate the guitar sounds that I hear from my favorite bands. The goal of this project was to build a POC of a deep learning model which takes guitar audio as input and tells the user which sound effect parameters to use in order to replicate the input sound.

I recorded 40 minutes of guitar data and used a custom generator to programmatically apply various levels of echo and reverb to random 3-second sound clips for training.

The viewer will find that both model architectures scored well beyond the benchmark value. Lastly, I offer a detailed plan on how this project can be expanded to be more general to provide the greatest value to musicians while remaining scalable and easy to maintain.
